Blazor Server .NET 6 No Scroll on page load.

This isusse is somewhat ellusive and I have an accompanying video to show how to encounter this bug.

Basically you scroll down to the link at the bottom of the home page. Upon clicking the link the page redirect another page within the app and gets stuck at the botton of the page, thereby not scroll to the top as expected. This error dose not always occur and you might have to repeat this process up to ten times to get it to occur.
