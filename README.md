Blazor Server .NET 6 No Scroll on page load.

This issue is somewhat elusive, I have an accompanying video to show how to encounter this bug.

Basically, you scroll down to the link at the bottom of the home page. Upon clicking the link the page redirect another page within the app and gets stuck at the bottom of the page, thereby not scroll to the top as expected. This error does not always occur, and you might have to repeat this process up to ten times to get it to occur.
